How Vue.js made websites are rendered:
html -> template -> html

template has access to all data and methods in the vue instance without any prefix needed

but functions in methods: do need prefix this to access data

v-bind enable binding dynamic data to html element's attribute

All usage of data get re-rendered once the data changed. To stop, use v-once in template
Vue's template only output string, not html. (14)

Use v-html to output raw html, as long as raw html output is safe.

Use v-on:event to listent to event on certain element

Event object is automatically passed to function called by event listener e.g. mousemove

We can pass our own event object e.g. 2 to event listener function

Event modifier can handle event without affecting event details e.g. call function at JS

Key event modifier e.g. v-on:keyup.enter.space="alertMe"

v-model achieves 2-way binding

Functions in methods section called every time data in Vue instance changed, while functions in computed section rerun only when the data involved changed

While the section computed starts with function involving the data watched, the section watching starts with data watched
