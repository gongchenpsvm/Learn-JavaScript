How Vue.js made websites are rendered:
html -> template -> html
template has access to all data and methods in the vue instance without any prefix needed
but functions in methods: do need prefix this to access data
v-bind enable binding dynamic data to html
All usage of data get re-rendered once the data changed. To stop, use v-once in template
Vue's template only output string, not html.
Use v-html to output raw html, as long as raw html output is safe.
