Syllabus of Codecademy's Learn JavaScript 

1. Intro
There are three essential data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, and booleans.
We can write out anything to the console with console.log.
We can do math with operators like +, -, *, and /.
We can find the remainder after dividing two numbers with a modulus: %.
We can generate a random number with Math.random, then make it a whole number with Math.floor.
We write a single line comment with // and a multi-line comment with /* and */.
2. Variables
How to create variables.
How to change a variable's value.
How to interpolate, or insert, a variable into a string.
3. Control flow
if/else statements make binary decisions and execute separate code based on a condition.
We can add extra conditions with to if/else statements with else if conditions.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read, however they achieve the same result as if/else statements.
Comparison operators, like <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables. After they compare, they always return either true or false.
Logical Operators, like &&, ||, !==, and !, can compare two variables to see if a certain condition exists:
&& checks if both sides are true.
|| checks if either side is true.
!== checks if both sides are not equal.
! changes a variable that is true to false, and vice versa.
