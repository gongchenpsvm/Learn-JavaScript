Syllabus of Codecademy's Learn JavaScript 

1. Intro
There are three essential data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, and booleans.
We can write out anything to the console with console.log.
We can do math with operators like +, -, *, and /.
We can find the remainder after dividing two numbers with a modulus: %.
We can generate a random number with Math.random, then make it a whole number with Math.floor.
We write a single line comment with // and a multi-line comment with /* and */.

2. Variables
How to create variables.
How to change a variable's value.
How to interpolate, or insert, a variable into a string.

3. Control flow
if/else statements make binary decisions and execute separate code based on a condition.
We can add extra conditions with to if/else statements with else if conditions.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read, however they achieve the same result as if/else statements.
Comparison operators, like <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables. After they compare, they always return either true or false.
Logical Operators, like &&, ||, !==, and !, can compare two variables to see if a certain condition exists:
&& checks if both sides are true.
|| checks if either side is true.
!== checks if both sides are not equal.
! changes a variable that is true to false, and vice versa.

4. Function
Functions are written to perform a task.
Functions take data or variables, perform a set of tasks on them, and then return the result.
We can define parameters when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.

5. Scope
Scope is the idea in programming that some variables are acessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
Global Scope refers to variables that are accessible to every part of the program.
Functional Scope refers to variables created inside functions, which are not accessible outside of its block.

6. Arrays
Arrays are lists and are a way to store data in JavaScript. Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position. Arrays are created with brackets [].
We can access one item in an array using it's numbered position, with syntax like: myArray[0].
Arrays have a length property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.
Arrays also have their own methods, including push and pop, which add and subtract items from an array, respectively.

7. Loop
for loops allow us to repeat a block of code a known amount of times.
We can use a for loop inside another for loop to compare two lists.
while loops are for looping over a code block an unknown amount of times.
